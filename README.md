Gibbs_sampler
=============
Collapsed CRP gibbs sampler.
Base configuration on GibbsSampler.h and sufficientStatistics.h
The easiest way to run the sampler is through the command line. 
Just run "perl gibbsParser.pl" and the Sampler will perform inference from the file positionalInfo.txt
Need to have octave and perl(duuh) configured on the machine.
